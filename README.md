# deep-learning-rock-paper
The project aims to develop an interactive rockpaper- scissors game that utilizes hand gesture recognition through deep learning. Players will be able to make their choices (rock, paper, or scissors) by showing corresponding hand gestures to a webcam, and the computer's choice will be simulated.
